# Operations on strings and lists 

"""
A python string can be declared either 
by using a single quote or by using double quotes.
Strings are immutable but can be accesses and their indexing starts from 0

"""

# Example 

statement ='Dog is an animal'
print(statement)

# Using len to get the length of characters

 name = 'Bicycle'
 len(name)

 # Indexing

  name = 'bicycle'
  name[2] # It returns 2 as the answer

# Slicing a string

# sometimes you may want to display only a part of a string

name = 'bicycle'
name[3:5] # It gives 'yc'


# the str() converts any data type into a string

str(5+6y)
